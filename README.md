# Recipe Card App

A recipe card application built with React that displays various recipes with beautiful animations. The app uses lazy loading for images and animates the recipe cards when they come into view.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The app is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, from large desktops to small mobile devices.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are lazily loaded to improve performance, showing only when they are in the viewport.
- **Hover Effect**: When hovering over a recipe card, a subtle lift effect is applied.
- **Animation**: Recipe cards animate into view when they are scrolled into the viewport using the Intersection Observer API.
- **Grid Layout**: The cards are displayed in a grid layout, and the number of cards per row adjusts based on screen size.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **Intersection Observer API**: To detect when a recipe card enters the viewport and apply animations.
- **Lazy Loading**: To load images only when they are in the viewport.

Styling

The app uses custom CSS to achieve a clean, modern look. The styles are responsive, ensuring that the recipe cards adjust to different screen sizes.

CSS Features:

Hover Effect: When you hover over a recipe card, it lifts slightly, and the box-shadow increases.

Fade-In Animation: Recipe cards fade in and move upward when they come into the viewport, thanks to the Intersection Observer API.

Grid Layout: The recipe cards are displayed in a grid layout, with the number of cards per row adjusting based on the screen width.
